	<h1> Jaden Smith's WEB110 Course Contract </h1>
</header>
<main>
	<p>I, <a href ="introduction.html"> Jaden Smith</a> agree to abide by
		the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2020 WEB110-01 Internet/Web
		Fundamentals  with my instructor,	D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<h2> Workspace Setup </h2>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
	<p><em>Signed: Jaden Smith, 1/20/2020 </em></p>	 
	<p> Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.</p>
